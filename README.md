# 👋 Hey there, I’m Jeremy!

Welcome to my corner of GitHub! I’m a developer, tinkerer, and tech optimist with a passion for building cool things that make life a little easier (or at least more interesting).

## 🚀 What I'm Up To

- 🧠 **Building [Behavior Tally](https://behaviortally.com)** – A modern, BCBA-inspired tool to collect behavior data with style and efficiency.
- 🧙 **Learning Odin Language** – Because who doesn’t want to write fast, clean, and expressive code while feeling like a systems programming wizard?
- 🎮 **Diving into Game Dev** – Experimenting with game mechanics, pixel art, and engines. Expect some quirky projects and prototypes here soon!

## 🛠️ Tools & Tech I Like

- Languages: Odin, C#, TypeScript, Lua
- Tools: Neovim
- Favorite debugging tool: Swearing (followed by reading docs)
